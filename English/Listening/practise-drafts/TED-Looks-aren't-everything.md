## TED-Looks aren't everything

> TED听力素材练习

Hi, my name is ~~carin marson~~ **Cameron Russell**, for the last eh... ~~a bit~~ **little** while, I've been a model, actually for ten years.

~~I feel  because uncomfortable attention right now~~ **I feel like there's an uncomfortable tension in the room right now**, because I should not have ~~one~~ **worn** this dress, luckily i brought **an** outfit ~~to~~ change.

This is the first **outfit** ~~I~~ change on the **TED** stage, so you guys are pretty lucky to witness it, I think.

If some **of** the women are really ~~hores~~ **horrified** ~~I wanna~~ **when I** came out.

~~And I also know~~ **I'd also note** that I'm quite privileged to be able to transform what you think of me in a very brief 10 seconds.

Not everybody gets to do that.

These ~~things~~ **heels** are very uncomfortable, so good **thing I wasn't going to wear them**.高跟这双鞋穿着很不舒服，我不打算穿着它。

The worst part is putting ~~the~~ **this** sweater ~~out~~ **over** my  head because ~~you're going~~ that's when you'll laugh at me. Don't do anything **while it's over my head**.

~~I hope that not awkward than this picture~~ Hopefully not as awkward as that picture.

Image is powerful, but also, image is superficial, I just totally transformed what you thought of me in 6 seconds. In this picture, I **had** actually ~~did not~~ **never had** ~~have~~ a boyfriend in real life.

I was totally uncomfortable ~~of~~ **and** the photographer was ~~trying~~ **telling me** to ~~huge~~ **arch** my back, **and** put my hand~~, and I got his~~ **in that guy's** hair. 摄影师让我弓着背，摸那个男的头发。

And of course ~~baring~~ barring surgery（做手术） ~~work~~ **or** the **fake** tan（做棕褐色皮肤） that I got two days ago for work.

~~That~~ **There** is very little that we can do to transform how we look. And how we look ~~that~~ **though** it was superficial（表面的） and ~~ammunable~~ **immutable**（固定的） has a huge impact on our lives. 

Today, for me, being fearless, means being honest, and I'm on this stage, because I'm a model, I'm on this stage because I'm a pretty white woman, and **in** my industry, we called ~~it~~ **that a** "sexy girl". 

And I'm gonna answer the questions **that** people always ask me but ~~on~~ with the honest twist.（但，是一种诚实的方式） So the first question is how **do** you ~~can be~~ become a model, and I always just say ~~that~~ Oh, I was ~~skuddle it~~ **scouted**（我是被发现的）, but that means nothing, the real way that I became a model is I ~~want a lot~~ **won a genetic** lottery（极好的基因） and i ~~xxx resenopy for~~ **am the recipient of a** ~~the~~ legacy（遗产的继承者）, maybe you're wondering what is ~~the~~ **a** legacy（遗产）.

Well, for the past few centuries, we ~~here to~~ **have** define**d** beauty not just as health and youth and ~~semmitry~~ **symmetry**（身材匀称） that ~~were~~ **we're** biological**ly** program**med** to admire, but also as tall, ~~thunder~~ **slender**（高挑、苗条的体型） figures and femininity（女性气质） and white skin, and this is ~~the~~ **a** legacy that was built for me and it's the legacy that I've been cashing out on（是我一直在兑现的遗产）.

And I know there're people ~~and~~ **in the** audience who are skeptical at this point, and maybe there're some ~~fashonist~~ **fashionistas** **who are** ~~says were~~ like "Wait, Naomi, ~~Tyrag~~ **Tyra**, ~~John~~ **Joan** Smalls, ~~Luwion~~ **Liu Wen**" and first I commend ~~to~~ **you on** your models knowledge are very impressive.

But unfortunately I have to inform you that in 2007 ~~are~~ **a** very inspired ~~and while you~~ NYU ~~are a~~ PhD student counted all the models on the ~~round way~~ **runway**, every single one who was hired and of the 677 models that were hired only 27 or less than 4% were ~~not~~ **non-**white.

The next question people always ask ~~me~~ is "Can I be a model when I grow up?", and the first answer is "I don't know, ~~and~~ **they** don't put me in charge of that". But the second answer ~~that~~ **and what** I really want to say ~~with~~ **to** these **little** girls is "Why? you know, you can be anything, you could be the **P**resident of the United States, or the inventor of the next internet, or the ninja cardio-thoracic surgeon poet which could be awesome because you could be the first one."

If after these amazing lists ~~`you say~~ **they still are like** no no , I want to be a model, well then I say, Be my boss. Because I'm not in charge of anything, and you could be **the editor in** ~~achevent~~ **chief** of **American Vogue**, the CEO of ~~the French Voge~~ H&M or the next **Steven Meisel**.

Saying **that** you want to be a model when you grow up is ~~a kind thing~~ **akin to saying that** you ~~wanna~~ **want to** win a PowerBall（中彩票） when you grow up, it's, you know, out of your control, it's awesome, and it's not a career path. I will demonstrate ~~a few~~ **for you** now. 10 years ~~I've~~ of accumulated model knowledge, because unlike ~~cardio thratic~~ **cardiothoracic** surgeons it can just be distilled ~~right? and~~ right now（这个职业只能立足于当下，无法长期发展）.

So if the photographer is right there, and the light is right there, ~~and~~ like ~~this is~~ **a nice** HMI, and the client says **"Cameron, We want a walking shot"** ~~is camera me on walking shop~~. Well, then this leg goes first, ~~the next longest~~ **nice and long**, this arm goes back, this arm goes ~~fore~~ forward, the head ~~are~~ **is at** three quarters, and you just go and back and forth, just ~~like~~ do that, and **then** you look back **at your** imaginary ~~your~~ friends, three hundred, four hundred, five hundred times. It ~~was like~~ **will look** something like this. Hopefully less awkward than ~~I want to middle with it~~ **one in the middle**, I don't know what happened there.

Unfortunately, after you've gone ~~the~~ **to** school, and you have a resume, you've done a few jobs, you can't say anything anymore. If you say you want be the **P**resident of the United States, but your resume reads : "underwear model: ten years." People give you funny ~~like~~ **look**.

The next question people always ask me is : "Did they ~~really touch~~ **retouch all** the photos（修照片）". "Yeah, they pretty much ~~we touch~~ **retouch all** the photos, but that's only a small component~~s~~ of what's happening".

This picture is ~~a~~ **the** very first picture that I ever took. And it's also the very first time that I had ~~one~~ **worn a** bikini. And I didn't even have my period **yet**, I know we're ~~going~~ **getting** personal, But, you know, I was a young girl.

This ~~one were~~ **is what I** look like **with** my grandma just a few months earlier. Here's me on the same day as they shoot my friend **got** ~~come~~ to come with me. Here's me at the Slumber Party a few days before I shot ~~at~~ French Vogue. Here's me on the Soccer Team and V magazine. And here's me today. 

And I hope what you're seeing is that these pictures are not pictures of me, they are constructions.

And they are constructions by **a group of** professionals, ~~Hell sails~~ **by hairstylists and makeup artists and** photographers and **stylists**, **all of their assistants and pre-production and post-production**, ~~the sessions, in proper production~~ and they build these, that's not me.

Next question people always ask me is "~~Did~~ Do you get free stuff?". I do have too many ~~eiden shares~~ **8-inch heels** which I never get to wear except **for** earlier. 

But the free stuff that I get is the free stuff I get in real life **and** that's we don't like to talk about.

I grew up in Cambridge, and one time I ~~want to store my money~~ **went into a store and I forgot my money** and they gave me ~~a~~ the dress for free. When I was a teenager, I was driving with my friend who was ~~not often~~ **an awful** ~~driving~~ **driver and** she **ran a red** and of course, we got pulled over, and all ~~we~~ **it** took was **a** "sorry ~~to the~~ officer",  **and we were on our** way. 

And I got this free things because of how I look not who I am, and there are people paying a cost for how they look not who they are. 

I live in New York and last year of the 140,000 teenagers ~~are resxx~~ **that were stopped and frisked**（被叫停车并且搜身）.  86% of them were black and Latino, and most of them were young ~~man~~ men. And there are only 177,000 young black and Latino **men** in New York, so for them, it's not a question of "~~way~~ **Will** I got stopped" but "How many times **will** ~~we~~ ~~got~~ **I get** stopped", when ~~we got~~ will I get stopped. 

When I was researching ~~those~~ **this** talk, I found out that of the 13-year-old girls in US 53% don't like their bodies, and ~~now~~ **that** **numbers** ~~grows~~ **goes** to 78% by the time **that** they are 17.

So the last question people ask me is, you know, what is **it** like to be a model? I think the answer that they're looking for is, "if you are a little bit ~~skinny~~ **skinner**, ~~or~~ **and** you have ~~shiny~~ **shinier** hair, you will be so happy and fabulous".

And when we ~~back to stage~~ **are backstage**, we give ~~the~~ **an** answer that maybe make ~~senses~~ it **seem** like that we say it's really amazing to travel, and it's amazing to get to work with creative ~~and~~, inspired, ~~passion~~ **passionate** people. and those things are true, but ~~the~~ **they're** only one half of the story because the thing that we never say on ~~the~~ camera that I've never said on camera is I am insecure.

And I'm insecure because I have to think about what I look like evey day. And if you ever are wondering, you know, if I have thinner ~~size~~ **thighs**（修长的大腿） and shinier hair, will I be happier?

And you just ~~seem to~~ **need to** meet a group of models, because they have the thinnest thighs, **the** shiniest hair and **the** coolest clothes, and **they're** the most physically insecure women probably ~~in~~ **on** the planet.

So when I was ~~readying~~ **writing** this talk, I found it~~'s~~ very difficult to strike ~~in~~ **an** ~~the~~ honest balance, because on the one hand, I ~~feel~~ **felt** very uncomfortable to come out here and say "look, ~~have you these benefits from these decks stack to my favor~~ **I've received all these benefits from a deck stacked in my favor**（我凭着天生的优势得到了这么多东西）, " And **it** also ~~I~~ felt ~~very~~ **really** uncomfortable to follow that up with and it doesn't always make~~s~~ me happy.

But mostly it was difficult to unpack ~~the~~ a legacy of gender and racial ~~impression~~ oppression（种族歧视的职业传统） when I am the one **of the** biggest ~~beneficaliers~~ **beneficiaries**.

But I'm also happy and honored to ~~appear~~ **be up here** and I think that's great **that** I got to come, you know, before 10 or 20 or 30 years **had** ~~pasted~~ **passed**, I**'d** had more agency ~~on~~ **in** my career（10、20、30年之后我和模特行业之间有越来越多的阻隔）, because maybe then I wouldn't tell the story **of** how I got my first job, how I paid for college, which ~~is~~ **seems** so important right now.

If there's a ~~take way~~ **takeaway** to this talk（有所收获，使你受益）, I hope it**'s** that we ~~will~~ all feel more comfortable, ~~econoleging~~ acknowledging, the power of image in our ~~presived~~ **perceived** successes, and our **perceived** failures（我们所理解的成功和失败）.
