## TED-How-to-gain-control-of-your-free-time

When people find out ~~are right~~ **I write** about time management , they assume two things.

One, is that I'm always on time. and I'm not. 

I have four small children, and I would like to blame them for my occasional tardiness.

But sometimes it's just not their fault.

I was once late to my own speech on time management.

We all ~~have~~ **had** to just take this moment together~~, save~~ and savor that irony.

The second thing they assume is that I have lots of tips and tricks for saving bits of time here and there.

Sometime ~~here are~~ **I'll hear** from magazines that ~~they~~ are doing ~~storyline~~ **a story along these lines** ~~on this lange~~ generally on "How to help ~~the~~ **their** readers find ~~the~~ **an** extra hour in ~~a~~ **the** day".

 有时候我听说一些杂志在写这方面的故事，通常都是关于教读者如何在一天中获得额外的一个小时。

 And the idea~~s~~ **is** that we'll shave bits of time ~~of~~ **off** everyday activities, add~~ed~~ **it** up, **and** we**'ll** have **time for** ~~a~~ **the** good stuff.

基本思路就是从日常的每个活动中挤出一点时间，加起来，然后我们就有时间去做更有意思的事情了。

And I question the entire ~~promise~~ **premise** of this ~~peace~~ **piece**. But I'm always ~~interesting~~ interested in ~~here~~ hearing what they've ~~coming~~ come up with before they ~~callmay~~ call me.

我对这个说话持保留意见，不过我还是愿意听听她们在找我之前有什么想法？

So some of my favorite, doing ~~areaing~~ **errands where** ~~on the way we~~ **you** only have to make right**-**hand ~~terms~~ **turns**, being extremely ~~jurdious~~ **judicious** ~~on myc resege~~ **in microwave usage** ~~it's~~ **it says** three to ~~three half~~ **three-and-a-half** minute**s** **on the** package, we're totally ~~get~~ **getting in** on the bottom ~~set on~~ **side of** that.

 我最喜欢的几个是：只完成那些只需要右转的事；在用微波炉时，要极度审慎：当食物包装上面写了3到3.5分钟时，我们要挑时间最短的那个。

And my personal favorite**,** which make**s** sense on some level is **to** ~~DV~~ **DVR** ~~aotograph~~ **your** favorite shows, so you can ~~fastword~~ **fast-forward** ~~to the clue shows~~ through the commercials. ~~that we'll~~ **That way, you** save ~~about~~ eight minutes every half ~~an~~ hour, so in the course of 2 hours **of** watching TV, you ~~could~~ find 32 minutes to exercise. Which is true.

我个人最喜欢的是，录下你最喜欢看的电视剧，然后你就可以跳过广告了。其实某种程度上说，还蛮有道理的。这样，你每半个小时就可以挤出八分钟，那么你用来看电视的两个小时中，可以挤出32分钟锻炼的时间。

You know another way to find 32 minutes to exercise? Don't watch 2 hours **of** TV a day right?

Anyway, the idea~~s~~ **is we'll** save bits of time here and there, add~~ed~~ **it** up, **we will finally** ~~your find to~~ **get to** everything you want to do.

这里省点那里省点时间，最后加起来就有时间做我们想做的事了。

But after studying how successful people spen~~t~~**d** their time, and looking at ~~these~~ their schedules hour~~s~~ by hour~~s~~, I think this idea has ~~a~~ **it** completely backward.

我觉得这个想法是完全本末倒置的。

We don't build the lives we want by saving time, we build the lives we want and then time saves itself.

时间会自然而然节省出来。

Here's what I mean. I recently did a time diary project, looking at ~~a thousand one~~ **1001** days in the lives **of** extremely busy ~~woman~~ women.

观察最忙碌的女士生命中的1001天。

They ~~have~~ **had** demanding jobs, sometimes ~~they're on~~ **their own** businesses, kids to care for, maybe parents to care for, community commitments, busy, busy people.

她们工作繁忙，有时候是自己的生意，...，社区服务等等。

I had them keep ~~their~~ track~~ed~~ **of their** time for **a** week~~s~~, so I could add ~~it~~ up how much they have worked and slept, and I interview**ed** them about ~~the~~ **their** strategies, ~~from~~ **for** my book. One of the women whose time log I study she goes out (for) **on** a Wednesday night for something, she comes home to find ~~out~~ **that** her water heater has broken, and there is now water all over her basement.

为了写我的书，我还采访了解她们的常用策略。回家发现热水器坏了，地下室都被水淹了。

If you**'ve** ever had anything like this happen to you, you know it's a hugely damaging, **frightening, sopping** mess. So she ~~is still~~ **is dealing with the immediate** ~~after mass~~ **aftermath** that night, next day she's got the ~~plummers~~ **plumbers** coming in, ~~the~~ day after that professional cleaning ~~doing ruin the carpet~~ **crew dealing with the ruined carpet**. All ~~of these have been~~ **this is being** recorded ~~in~~ **on** her time log.

令人崩溃和沮丧，于是那个晚上她立刻着手处理，第二天她找了一个水管工，第三天找了专业的清理人员来处理损坏的地毯。这些都被计算在她的时间表里。

~~once~~ **Winds up** taking ~~her~~ 7 hours **of** her week, 7 hours, That's like finding an extra hour in a day.

总共花了她一周中的七个小时，这等于每一天挤出一个小时。

But I'm sure if you **had** ask**ed** her ~~to try to~~ **at the start of** ~~a~~ **the** week, could you find 7 hours to train for ~~trython~~ a triathlon? could you find 7 hours to mentor 7 worthy people? I'm sure she would have said what most of us would said which is: No! Can't you see how busy I am?

你能抽出7个小时来参加铁人三项吗？你能抽出七个小时来指导7个有潜力的人吗？

Yeah, when she had **to find** ~~found~~ 7 hours, because there is water all over her basement. She found 7 hours. and what ~~that~~ **this** shows us is that time is highly elastic. We can not make more time, but time will ~~stratch~~ **stretch** to ~~a comedy~~ accommodate, what we choose to put **into** it.

时间是有弹性的，我们没法创造出更多的时间，但是时间会自己调整去适应我们选择去做的事情。

So the key to time management is treating our priorities as the equivalent of that broken water ~~here~~ **heater**. and ~~together~~ **to get at** this, I~~'d~~ like to use ~~some~~ language from one of ~~these~~ the busiest people I ever interviewed. By busy I mean she was running a small business ~~of~~ with 12 people on the **payroll**, she had 6 children ~~on~~ **in** her spare time. I was getting in touch with her to set up ~~the~~ **an** interview ~~and~~ **on** how she "had it all" -  that phrase. 

对待重要的事情就要像对待坏掉的热水器一样。为了做到这一点，我要借用我采访过最忙的人说过的一句话。忙我指的是她经营着一个小企业，请了十二名员工，空余时间还要照顾她的6个孩子。我联系上她想要采访她关于她是怎么做到“无所不能”的。

I remember it was **a** Thursday morning, she was not ~~evaluable~~ **available** to speak with me, of course, but the reason she was ~~unevaluable~~ **unavailable** to speak with me is that she was out for **a** hike. Because it was a beautiful spring morning. and she wanted to go for a hike. So of course ~~it~~ **this** makes me even more ~~intride~~ intrigued. 

这样的她让我更加感兴趣了。

When I finally do catch up with her, she explains  it like ~~that~~ **this**, she says,  listen, Lora, everything I do, every minute I spend is my choice and rather than say I don't have time to do ~~exwhiosy~~ **x, y or z**, she would say, I don't do x, y or z, because it's not a priority. I don't have time often means it's not a priority. 

If you think about it, that's really more accurate language, I mean I could tell you I don't have time to **dust my blinds**, but that's not true. If you offer**ed** to pay me 100,000 dollars to ~~go dus my blines~~ **dust my blinds**, I ~~will~~ **would** get to it pretty quickly.

清理百叶窗，虚拟语气自动判断语法时态。

Since that's not got to happen, I can acknowledge ~~that~~ this is not **a** matter of lacking time, **it** is that I don't want to do it. Using this language remind**s** us that ~~the~~ time is ~~the~~ **a** choice, and ~~grated~~ granted, There may be horrible consequences for making different choices. I'll give you that. But we are smart people, and certainly ~~on~~ **over** the long run. We have the power to fill our lives with the things that deserve to be there.

既然那不可能发生，我可以说不是因为时间不够，而是因为不想做。这么说可以提醒我们时间是一种选择。我会告诉你，当然不同的选择有时会带来可怕的后果。我们有能力去选择做一些值得做的事。

So how do we do that? How do we treat our priorities as the equivalent of that broken water heater? Well, first we need to figure out what they are.

首先我们需要找出哪些事最重要

I~~‘m gonna~~ **want to** give you two strategies for thinking about this. The first, on the professional side, I'm sure many people coming up to the end of the year **are** giving or getting ~~on your~~ **annual** performance reviews.

第一个，从职业的角度上来说，我相信许多人会在年底的时候发出或者收到年度绩效审查。

You look back over your successes over ~~a~~ **the** year, your opportunit~~y~~**ies** for growth. And ~~this service is~~ **this serves its** purpose, but I find it's more ~~facutive~~ effective to do this looking forward.

你回头看看这一年的成功和“成长的机会”，这的确起到了作用，但是我发现往前看会更有效。

So ~~why don't~~ **I want** you **to** pretend **it's** the end of the next year, you're giving yourself a performance review, and it has been an absolutely amazing year for you professionally.

我想让你们把这当作下一年的年底，你在给自己做年度绩效审查。在专业方面，这一年的表现非常出众。

What 3-5 things did you do that made it so amazing? So you can write next year's performance review now. And you can do this for your personal life too. I'm sure many of you like me, come December, get cards that ~~can tanly~~ **contain these** folded up sheets of colored paper, ~~and~~ **on** which is written what is known as the family holiday letter.

是哪3到5件事使这一年变得如此出众？在十二月都会收到这种夹着彩色纸的卡片。上面写着“家庭假日信件”。

Bit of ~~rechered jounave~~ a wretched genre of literature, really, going on about how amazing everyone in the ~~how so they did~~ **household is**, even more ~~sentalating~~ **scintillating**, how busy everyone in the household is.

听起来像是一个挺悲惨的文学题材，谈论家里每个人有多了不起。或者更精彩点，家里每个人有多忙。

But these letters ~~are~~ **serve a** purpose, which ~~was~~ **is** that they tell your friends and your family what you did in your personal life that matter**ed** to you over ~~across~~ the year.

但这些信件是有用的，它们告诉你的朋友和你的家人你这一年里做了什么对个人生活有意义的事。

So ~~they cut it down~~ **this year's kind of done**, but I want ~~to~~ you **to** pretend it's the end of ~~the~~ next year, and it has been an absolutely amazing year for you and **the** people you care about.

那么今年快要结束了，对你和你关心的人来说，这是无与伦比的一年。

What 3-5 things did you do that made it so amazing? So you can write next year's family holiday letter now. Don't send it. But you can write it. 

哪3到5件事让你这一年表现如此出色

Now between **the** performance review and **the** family holiday letter, we have a list of 6-10 goals we can work on in the next year, and now we need to break ~~this~~ **these** down ~~and~~ into ~~durable~~ **doable** ~~to~~ step**s**, so maybe you wanna write a family history, or first you can read some other family histories, get **a** sense for the style. 

现在，有了绩效评估表和写给家人的信，我们就有了6到10个明年可以努力的目标。我们需要先把它们分成可行的阶段性任务

Then maybe ~~you~~ think about the questions you wanna ask your relatives, set up appointment**s** to interview them. Or you maybe you wanna ~~write~~ **run** a 5k, so you need to find a ~~reason~~ **race** ~~to~~ **and** sign up ~~being~~, figure out **a** training plan, and dig ~~the~~ **those** shoes **out of the** back ~~up~~ **of** the closet. 

又或者你想跑一个5km的马拉松，你需要先找一个竞赛报名然后做一个培训计划。从衣柜里翻出你的运动鞋。

Then, this is the key, we treat our priorities as the equivalent of that broken water heater by putting them into our schedules first. and we do this by thinking through ~~of~~ **our** weeks before we are in them.

把它们优先放入我们的日程表里，我们要在事情发生的几周前就先想好。

I find a really good time to do this is Friday afternoons, Friday afternoon is ~~one of the commonest I~~ **what an economist might** called a "low opportunity cost" time.

Most of us are not ~~setting~~ **sitting** there ~~our~~ **on** Friday afternoon saying, "I'm excited to make progress ~~to our~~ **toward my** personal and professional priorities right now". But we are willing to think about what those should be. So take a little bit of time, Friday afternoon make yourself a three**-**category priority list~~s~~, career, relationships, self.

我们大部分人不会在周五下午想着我要朝我的个人和职业生涯的首要事件迈进了。

Making a three-category list~~s~~ reminds us that there ~~are~~ should be something in all three categories. Career we think about, relationships, self not so much. But anyway just ~~show the lists~~ **s short list**, 2 or 3 items **in** each, then look out **over** the whole of the next week, and see where you can plan them in.

可以提醒我们每个类别里都该有些什么事情。它会帮助我们看清下一周，如何在下周计划这些事情。

Where you plan them in is up to you. I know this is going to be more complicated for some people than others, I mean some people's lives **are** just harder than others. It is not going to be easy to find time to take that poetry class, if you're caring for multiple children on your own, I get that.

And I don't want to minimize ~~any one~~ **anyone's** struggle, but I do think that the numbers I **am about** to tell you are empowering. There are 168 hours in a week, that is a lot of time. If you are working a full**-**time job, so 40 hours a week, sleeping 8 hours a night, so 56 hours a week, that leaves 72 hours for other things, that is a lot of time. You say you're working 50 hours a week, maybe a main job and a side hustle, that leaves 62 hours for other things, you say you're working 60 hours, well that leaves 52 hours for other things, you say you're working more than 60 hours, are you sure?

我接下来要说的数字会改变你的看法。

There ~~is~~ **was** once a study comparing people's estimated work weeks ~~for~~ **with** time diaries, found that people ~~are~~ claiming 75+ hours **work** weeks were off **by** about 25 hours. You can guess in which ~~the~~ direction right.

曾经有一个研究对比了人们估计的工作时间和实际的工作日记，他们发现那些声称自己一周工作超过75小时的人有25小时的误差。你可以猜到这个误差是多了还是少了对吧。

Anyway, in 168 hours a week, I think we can find time for what matters to you. If you want to spend more time with your kids, you want to study ~~for~~ more **for a test you're** ~~texture~~ taking, you want to exercise for 3 hours and volunteer for 2, you can, and that is even if you are working ~~away~~ **way** more than full-time hours.

即使你的工作时间远超过法定时间。

So we have plenty of time which is great because guess what, we don't even need that much time to do amazing things, but when most of us ~~has~~ **have** bits of time, what do we do? ~~Plot~~ **Pull out** the phones, right? start deleting emails, so otherwise we're ~~part~~ **puttering** around the house or watching TV, but small moments can have great power.

或者在家里闲逛，看电视

You can use your bits of time for bits of joy, maybe it's choosing to read something wonderful on the bus ~~we're~~ **on the way** to work. I know **when** I had a job that require**d** two bus rides and **a** subway ride every morning, I used to go to the library on weekends to get stuff to read, ~~may~~ **it made** the whole experience almost enjoyable. 

这几乎让我的生活更丰富了。

Breaks ~~it~~ **at** work can be ~~useful~~ used for meditating ~~a pren~~ **or praying**, ~~a~~ **if** family dinner is out because of your crazy work schedule, maybe family breakfast could be a good substitute.

工作间隙的休息时间可以用来冥想或者祷告。如果你因为工作太忙而不能吃家庭晚餐，可以试一下家庭早餐。

It's about looking at the whole of ~~once~~ **one's** time, and seeing where the good stuff can go. I truly believe this, there is time, even if we are busy, we have time for what matters, and when we focus on what matters, we can build the lives we want and **in** the time we've got.

这就是看一个人所有的时间，然后找到什么时候可以做想做的事。
