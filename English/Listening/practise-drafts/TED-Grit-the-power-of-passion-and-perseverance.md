## TED-Grit : the power of passion and perseverance

> TED听力练习素材

When i was 27 years old, I left a very demanding job in ~~Mansripxx~~ **management** consulting, for a job that was even more demanding, teaching. 

~~and~~ **I** when to teach ~~7~~ 7th ~~greaters~~ **graders** math in the New York City public schools, and like ~~many~~/**any** teacher, I make ~~quiztizen~~ **quizzes** and tests, i ~~give~~ **gave** out homework assignments, when ~~their~~ **the** work came back, I ~~calculate~~ **calculated** ~~the~~ grades.

What ~~extracts~~ **struck** me was that IQ was not the only difference between my best and my worst students. 

Some of my strongest performers did not have ~~stracxxx~~ **stratospheric** IQ scores, some **of** my smartest students ~~were~~ **weren't** doing so well, and that got me thinking, **the** kind**s** of thing**s** you need to learn **in** 7**th** grade~~s~~ math sure they are hard, ~~gracious~~ **ratios**, ~~decimous~~ **decimals**, the area of the ~~paerlai gram~~ **parallelogram**.

~~the this~~ **But these** concepts are not impossible, and i was firmly convinced that every one of my students could learn the material if they work**ed** hard and long enough. 

After ~~7~~ **several** more year**s** old of teaching, I came to the conclusion that what we need in education is **a** much better understanding of students and learning from a motivational perspective, from a psyc**h**ological perspective. 

In education, the one thing we know how to measure best is IQ. 

But what if doing well in the school and in life, depends on much more than your ability to learn quickly and easily. 

So ~~enlaugh?~~ **I left** the classroom, and **I** when to graduate school to become a ~~phycologist~~ psychologist. 

**I** ~~a~~ start**ed** studying kids and adults in all kinds of super challenging settings, and in every study my question was who is successful here and why. 

My research team and i went to **West Point Military Academy**, we try to predict which ~~cedates~~ **cadets** will stay in military training, and which ~~will~~ **would** drop out.

We went to the **National Spelling Bee**? and tr**ied** to predict which children would ~~defance~~ **advance** ~~far this~~ **farthest** in competition. 

We studied ~~working~~ **rookie** teachers, working in ~~a very~~ **really** tough neighborhoods, asking which teachers are still going to be here in teaching by the end of the school year, and of those, who will be the most effective ~~and~~ **at** improving learning ~~I'll come~~ **outcomes** for there students. 

We partner**ed** ~~was~~ ~~provided~~ **with private** companies, asking which ~~they sells people~~ **of these salespeople** ~~will gonna~~ **is going to** keep their jobs, and who is ~~gonna~~ **going** earn the most money.

~~and~~ **In** all those very different ~~contests~~ **contexts**, one characteristic emerged as a significant predictor **of** success, and **it** wasn't social intelligence, **it** wasn't good lucks, physical health, and **it** wasn't IQ, it was grit. 

Grit is passion and perseverance for very long-term ~~goes~~ **goals**. Grit is having a stamina. Grit is sticking with your future, day in, day out, not just for the week, not just for the month, but for years, and working ~~very~~ **really** hard to make that future **a** reality. 

Grit is living life like it's a marathon not a sprint. 

A few years ago, ~~a~~ **I** start**ed** studying grit in **the** Chicago public schools. 

I ask**ed** thousands of high school juniors to take grit questionnaires, and then ~~when it~~ **waited** around more than a year to see who ~~will~~ would graduate. 

**T**urns out that gritt**i**er kids ~~was~~ **were** significantly more likely to graduate, even when I match**ed** them on every characteristic I could measure, things like family income, standardize**d** achievement test scores, even how ~~save kidsfell?~~ **save kids felt** when they ~~are~~ were at school. 

So it's not just ~~that waste points~~ **at West Point** or the ~~international spellingb~~ **National Spelling Bee** that ~~great~~ **grit** matters. **I**t's also in school, especially for kids ~~that rest~~ **at risk** for dropping out. 

To me, the most shocking thing about grit is how little we know, how little ~~signs~~ science knows about building it. 

Every day parents and teachers ask me, "how do i build ~~gritting~~ **grit in** kids?", "what do i do to teach kids a *solid work ethic*?", "how do I keep the motivate for the long run?". 

The honest answer is i don't know. What i do know is that talent doesn't make you gritty. 

Our data show very clearly that there are many talented individuals who simply do not follow through on their commitments. In fact, **in** our data, grit is usually unrelated or even *inversely* related to measures **of** talent, 

So far the best idea I've heard about building grit in kids is something called "growth mindsets".

This is an idea developed ~~in~~ **at** Stanford **U**niversity by ~~Caroled Wike~~ **Carol Dweck**, and it is the belief that the ability to learn is not fixed, that it can change with your ~~affright~~ **effort**.

Dr.**Dweck** ~~show~~  **has shown that** when kids read and learn about ~~bring~~ **the brain**, and how it changes and ~~growth~~ **grows** in response to challenge, they are much more likely to *persevere* when they fail, because they don't believe that failure is **a** permanent condition.

So growth **mindset** ~~in my said~~ is **a** great idea for building grit. 

But we need more and that's ~~why we are~~ **where I'm** going to end my remarks because that's ~~what~~ **where** we are, that's the world that stands before us. 

We need to take our best ideas ~~are~~ **our** strongest institutions and we need to test them. 

We need to measure whether we've been successful and we have to be ~~rolling~~ **willing** to fail, to be wrong, to start over again with lessons learned. 

In other words, we need to be gritty about getting our kids grittier.
